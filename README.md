# TheButton
A bleak text based resource managment game.
To play, run the code file in python.

After entering your name, the game has a couple of paragraphs to introduce itself.
You have to survive a certain number of days. The resources you manage are food, bills, and your mental state.
Each day you may press a button, not press the button, or entertain yourself, and there is a chance for a simple random event.
Also each day your food will decrease, your bills will go up, and your mental state will change.
If you press the button, a person will die and you will be rewarded money. Your mental state will also change.
There is a chance this person is your friend, which will change your mental state further.
There is also a chance this person will be you, in which case you will lose the game.
If you do not press the button, then you will simply pass the day with whatever changes that will mean.
If you choose to entertain yourself, a random activity will be picked, which has a chance to go well or poorly.
This will also change your mental state accordingly.
If you are too depressed for too long, if you starve for too long, or if you don't pay your bills for too long, you will lose the game.
